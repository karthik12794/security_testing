Task-3: Security Testing for Web Applications

--------------------------------------------------

1. Objective

The objective of this task is to perform security testing on a sample web application to identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

--------------------------------------------------

2. Application Tested

Website URL: http://demo.testfire.net

This is a demo web application used for security testing practice.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Security Testing Performed

3.1 SQL Injection Testing

Test Description:
SQL Injection allows attackers to bypass authentication by injecting SQL commands into input fields.

Test Performed:
Entered ' OR '1'='1 in both username and password fields on the login page.

Result:
Login was successful without valid credentials.

Conclusion:
The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Mitigation:
- Use prepared statements
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Do not expose database errors

--------------------------------------------------

3.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing

Test Description:
XSS allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser.

Test Performed:
Entered <script>alert("XSS")</script> into input fields.

Result:
The behavior was observed and documented.

Mitigation:
- Sanitize user input
- Encode output data
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

--------------------------------------------------

4. Conclusion

Security testing revealed that the application contains SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Proper security controls should be implemented to prevent attacks.
